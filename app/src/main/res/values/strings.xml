    <string name="large_text">
      "Not everyone live their dream. Even more, not everyone build dreams. The founders of Borenos Fried Chicken chose to build not just theirs, but the people of Sabah’s too. Brought up abroad, they have seen possibilities, potentials and understood what needed to be done in bringing their beloved hometown to the eyes of the world. Their inspiration is the people, their purpose is the growth of Sabah, their drive is Borneo pride.\n\n"

        "Why then, fried chicken? Simple, delicious and enjoyable to be shared over small talks or family gathering. Just like home, bringing back the good old memories of ‘comfort food’. Dining at home has another perk; it’s nutritious. And so the idea of freshness and quality surfaced. Only good ingredients are to be used, only the quality ones. This is after all, for my home people.\n\n"

        "Part of the secret to Borenos’ signature tender juiciness comes from step-to-step perfection, with just the right amount of marination, breading skills and controlling the oil temperature to lock in flavors to achieve that golden coat of crispy skin, and tender meat.\n\n"
        "We know hard work is important, but what matters more is believing in ourselves.\n\n"

        "Borenos Fried Chicken is Sabah owned, for Sabahans, the next Borneo Pride.\n\n"
